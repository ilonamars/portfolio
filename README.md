# Ilona M #

My name is Ilona and I am a  manual software tester. 

With 12 years of experience in technical support, I have developed a keen eye for identifying software issues, working with the documentation and a strong ability to troubleshoot and report them efficiently under pressure of time.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects, including Apple's second line of support where I served as a senior customer technical support advisor and first line support employee. In all roles, I have gained a wealth of experience in testing complex software on different devices and operating systems. My experience in working with difficult clients has taught me to be patient, professional, and effective in communicating technical issues to technical and non-technical individuals.

Additional, I have abtained certifications in Agile Project Management and gained theoretical knowledge about ISTQB concepts, STLC processes, common technologies and tools used in quality assurance, such as Jira, Confluence, Postman, SQL, DevTools and I am still improving my skills through various online courses, including Udemy – as a fast learner, always eager to expand my knowledge and skill set.
